## niceplots

This code can help in producing nice plots! It contains routines that change the default settings of ```matplotlib``` to larger fontsizes, better ticks, and using proper TeX rendering. 

## Prerequisites

Using this code requires:
* **python3**
* **matplotlib**

The example notebooks also require
* **numpy**

## Installing

Simply go to the root directory of this repository and execute
```pip install ./```

## Usage

For usage, it should be as simple as using

``` 
import niceplot.utils as nicepl
nicepl.init()
```

before executing your own ```matplotlib```-based plotting routines.
See the folder ```examples/``` for some example notebooks.

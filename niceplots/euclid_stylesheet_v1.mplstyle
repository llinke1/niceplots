## EUCLID STYLE SHEET
#
# This is a Matplotlib style configuration file for Euclid papers.
#
# If you wish to use this style sheet, you can place this style configuration file into your
# working directory and start your plotting script with (note the _inclusion_ of the file 
# extension!):
#
#     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
#     plt.style.use(['euclid_stylesheet.mplstyle'])
#
# Alternatively, you can place the style configuration file in your python path:
# <path to your python installation location>/site-packages/matplotlib/mpl-data/stylelib/
# This will allow you to use the style sheet in your plotting scripts from anywhere with (note
# the _omission_ of the file extension!):
#
#     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
#     plt.style.use(['euclid_stylesheet'])
#
# See 
# https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/customizing.html#customizing-with-style-sheets
# for more details on how to use matplotlib style sheets.
#
# The figure size and font size in this file are set up to play well with each other and to 
# create a figure that should fit well into one column of a double column paper, while having
# an appropriate font size that goes well with the paper font size. 
# Hence, my strong recommendation is: DO NOT MESS AROUND WITH `figsize` AND/OR `fontsize`!
#
# If you want to create a bigger figure spanning two columns, use the figwidth provided by this
# style sheet as a baseline, e.g.:
#
#     fw, fh = plt.rcParams['figure.figsize']
#     fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(2*fw, 2*fh))
#
# This should get you close to the desired figure size fitting neatly into the paper, while still
# preserving a consistent font size. You should NOT meddle with the font size!
#

# You (in most cases) should not be setting font sizes by specifying a number.
# The `font.size` property is the default font size for text, given in pts. Rather than changing
# font sizes manually everywhere, you should set a sensible number value for `font.size` once,
# and otherwise work with relative font size labels: 
# {xx-small, x-small, small, medium, large, x-large, xx-large}

font.family:        sans-serif     # use serif font
text.usetex:        True      # use LaTeX for all text handling
#mathtext.fontset:   cm        # use Computer Modern font, matching LaTeX default

font.size:          8.0       # font size that defines 'medium'
axes.titlesize:     large     # font size of the axes title
axes.labelsize:     medium    # font size of the x and y labels
legend.fontsize:    medium    # font size of legend entries
xtick.labelsize:    medium    # font size of the tick labels
ytick.labelsize:    medium    # font size of the tick labels
